## Engineering Focus

I build and operate real environments to understand how systems behave, and then turn that understanding into reproducible infrastructure.

My work is centred on:

- running complete setups end-to-end  
- making them rebuildable from scratch  
- extracting reusable platform components

## Working Model

My learning and implementation follow a continuous lifecycle:

**Knowledge Base → Reproducible Assets → Distilled Reasoning → Complete Systems**

- **Knowledge Base (Nectar)**  
  First-principles learning, deep execution notes, experiments, and verified understanding.

- **SilverStack**  
  Reproducible infrastructure — manifests, automation, and configurations used to rebuild working environments.

- **Engineering Blogs**  
  Focused write-ups of real implementations and problem-solving paths.

- **Projects (SilverOps)**  
  Complete systems where services are connected, exposed, secured, and operated together.

## Current Direction

- Kubernetes-based platforms  
- CI/CD infrastructure  
- Infrastructure as Code  
- Private networking & service exposure  
- System lifecycle automation

## Certifications

- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)  
- Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)

## Principles

- Rebuildable > runnable once  
- Systems > individual tools  
- Understanding > memorisation  
- Clarity over shortcuts
